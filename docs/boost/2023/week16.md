Get good with Git basics so we have a way to backup our code and notes. To use Git, however, we have to learn a little about public-key cryptography and secure shell (but not too much).

* What is the best Git learning resource?
* Just how much Git and GitHub do I need to learn?
* How does SSH apply to Git and GitHub?
* What is "public key cryptography" and why do I need to care?
* How do I create an "SSH public key" for GitHub?
* How do I create a repository (repo) and clone it locally?
* How do I add new stuff to the repo?
* How do I save (commit) stuff to the repo?
* How can I restore local changes (if I deleted file, for example)?
* How do I "introduce myself" to Git?
* How do I push my changes to GitHub?
