# 2023 Boost - Week 17

Let's jump into basic programming---specifically procedural programming. We'll use POSIX shell and bash as our first programming language (as odd as that sounds).

* Why learn shell as a first programming language?
* How can I create a program/script?
* What are some differences between bash and shell?
* What is syntax?
* What is a "string"?
* What is a carriage return and a line feed?
* Why does ! have special meaning to the shell?
* How do I "escape" a backslash?
* What is an "argument"?
* What is a "variable"?
* What are "environment variables" (or "system variables")?
* How do I use comments in shell code?
* What happens when I add multiple arguments to `printf`?
* How do I display the size and panes in TMUX?
* What are "fields" and "delimiters"?
* How do I pass data and variables into my program?
* What are "parameters"?
* How do I get the first argument into my program?
* How can I join a variable immediately preceding a string?
