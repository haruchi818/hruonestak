# 2023 Boost overview

Here's what we currently plan to cover. We always start on May the 4th and plan to take approximately 34 weeks with an estimated completion date sometime around January 13, 2024 based on approximately two hours per week (the least we have ever done per week). (Estimate is updated regularly and dynamically from the duration estimated below.)

!!! note "Consider waiting until we are done"

    Some people may find it better to simply wait until the entire 2023 Boost has completed so they can work as fast as they want through the material at their own pace---particularly if you are impatient and have a hard time with the informal, often disorganized way we work through the content.
