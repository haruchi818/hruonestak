# Taking notes

## Create a GitHub account

 What is GitHub and why do I care?

* Create a good name
    - Something you won't be ashamed of in your 30s
    - Use lower case (easier to type and remember)
    - Try to use the same "handle" that you use elsewhere
    - Consider *not* using your real name (if complicated)
    - Use something simple and memorable (this is your brand)
* Go follow other members of this years Boost

* Why should it be private?
* Create initial README.md automatically
* README.md is the *default* displayed for the repo or directory

## Learn Markdown basics

* What is Markdown and why do I care?
