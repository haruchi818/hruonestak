# How to I edit files from the terminal?

Changing the content of a file from the terminal can be done in one of two ways, usually referred to as **modes**: visual and command.

|Mode|Description|
|-|-|
|Visual|Open the file in an editor and interactively change its contents|
|Command|Run one or more commands that alter the content of the file

The most powerful editors combine these two modes together allowing the best of both worlds. But before you will fully appreciate this power you must first understand the UNIX philosophy and the use of UNIX filters (over plugins). To best master these concepts its best to learn several editors and commands

!!! note

    It's worth mentioning that sometimes opening a file to be edited using a graphic editor (such as VSCode) is also possible from the terminal command-line. For VSCode, for example, simply running the `code` command from the current directory using the VSCode terminal interface will open that directory into the graphic editor. In fact, it is often faster to navigate to the files that you wish to edit from the terminal interface and then open it graphically. Search for VSCode to see more examples of how the terminal can improve your graphic sessions as well.
