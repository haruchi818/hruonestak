# 2024 Boost overview

***Note this is just a place to update and plan for 2024 based on discoveries and changes in 2023.***

2024 returns to the original focus of installing and running Linux on "metal" meaning that participants are required to first acquire a machine on which to install Linux during the Boost and that we will be covering the installation onto a *real* machine (in addition to a *virtual* machine). The rest is the same as 2023.

!!! note "Consider waiting until we are done"

    Some people may find it better to simply wait until the entire Boost has completed so they can work as fast as they want through the material at their own pace---particularly if you are impatient and have a hard time with the informal, often disorganized way we work through the content.

## Before we begin ...

Here's what you need before considering the Boost. Don't worry, it's not much---especially considering that the Boost is entirely free (donations welcome). Most of your investment will be time, but most people will have some minimal financial expense as well. Check if you have this stuff already:

* Internet access from a secure local area network (home, school, etc.)
* A reliable computer connected to the Internet (Mac, Windows, Linux)
* A minimal computer with Intel chip on which to install Linux
* 8+ GB USB thumb drive that can be completely overwritten.

The reason for the first computer is to have a reliable connection to the Internet on which to initially take notes, create GitHub account, read documentation, watch Boost videos, download installation files, and create the USB drive you'll use to install Linux onto the second computer. This also frees you from any impact should the Linux installation fail for any reason.

### Finding a machine for Linux

Laptops and machines compatible with Linux can easily be found among those normally discarded, in fact, rejuvenating and recycling old hardware with Linux is one major advantage of learning Linux in general. But make no mistake, an "old" computer can serve as a *really* good Linux machine often comparable to those you would pay \$200/month for in the cloud. The feeling of restoring an old machine with Linux is nothing short of magical. Your friends and family will be amazed and you'll have a "full metal" Linux on which to hone your coder and hacker skills. If you do decide to buy a dedicated machine any computer (around \$150-\$200) will be more than enough.

!!! note "Linux isn't for gaming. Linux *is* the game."

    There is a lot of talk on the Internet about "Linux gaming" but most of it is frankly silly. While it is true that these days you can play most all games on Linux installed (on gaming hardware), and that Valve runs Arch Linux on SteamDeck, the entire point of Linux is to gain *real* skills and experience on *minimal* hardware. While others are spending way too much on gaming rigs and grinding to build virtual XP you'll be building *actual* experience and skills that are not only entertaining---even addicting---but *profitable*.

## Install Linux

It is still generally not possible to purchase Linux on a new computer (even if and when it is possible you generally wouldn't want to overpay to do it). Besides, there are few joys in the life of a techie more satisfying than breathing new life into old, discarded computers resurrecting them from the grave of deprecation to live again as truly great Linux servers and secondary workstations.
