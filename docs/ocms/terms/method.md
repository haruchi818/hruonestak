# Method

A **method** contains a procedure to fulfill an operation and provides a name and other identifying metadata. More than one unique method can fulfill the same operation. Methods are often rhetorically distinguished from the **operations** they fulfill with prepositions ("in Go", "in Python", "with LXC containers", "in French"). However, for the sake of documentation usually the operation name should be the main one indexed and searched. Methods may simply use the most appropriate preposition as their main title text (in sentence case).
